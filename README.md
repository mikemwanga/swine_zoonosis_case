### Abstract
Zoonotic transmission of influenza A viruses (IAV) at the pig-human interface poses a risk for the emergence of novel IAV variants strains with pandemic potential, underscoring the need for continuous epidemiological and genomic surveillance. Here, we report pig-to-human transmission of swine H1N1 (swH1N1) from a herd to their caretaker, both presenting with influenza-like symptoms. Nasal swab samples were RT-qPCR positive for IAV, and whole-genome sequencing revealed >99.9% sequence identity between hosts. Phylogenetic analysis placed the strains within the Eurasian-avian swH1N1 lineage, clade 1C.2.2, forming a monophyletic Swiss cluster. This study provides strong evidence of pig-human swH1N1 transmission and underlines underscores the zoonotic potential of enzootic swine IAVs. Although onward human-human transmission was not confirmed, such spillover events raise concern for pandemic potential of zoonotic variantsstrains. Our findings emphasize the need for active One Health surveillance integrating epidemiological and genomics data to enable early detection of emerging health threats and strengthen pandemic preparedness.
